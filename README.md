# Pokemon Go WebAPI

## 1. Description 

This project aims to provide a JSON API allowing to retrieve data from the Pokemon Go servers reachable by any system connected to the Internet. 
The system is based on the [Tjado's](https://github.com/tejado) work, [pgoapi](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi).   

The service also propose a "card" system to show your ingame progression to your friends at https://chaipokoi.github.io/Pokemon-Go-WebAPI/. 

Please note that your login informations are encrypted, not saved and will not be used by anyone expect yourself. 

## 2. How to use

### 2.1 Use the API

The API is already reachable at https://pokemon-chaipokoi.rhcloud.com/api  
In order to work, the API expects an access token created with the user's credentials. To protect your data, the credentials must be encrypted with RSA (PKCS#1 v1.5) and encoded in urlsafe base64.

#### The process

* Get the API public key at https://pokemon-chaipokoi.rhcloud.com/pubkey
* Format the credentials in the following format: username&password
* Encrypt the credentials with RSA (PKCS#1 v1.5) and the given public key
* Encode the encrypted credentials in urlsafe base64 to produce your access token.
* Access the API at https://pokemon-chaipokoi.rhcloud.com/api?params=your_access_token&requests=your_requests
* Get your data !

(A code sample is present in the example directory)

your_requests must be a string containing your differents requests separated by a ",".  
e.g: https://pokemon-chaipokoi.rhcloud.com/api?params=your_access_token&requests=get_player,get_inventory

The complete list of the available request is [here](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi/wiki/api_functions).
